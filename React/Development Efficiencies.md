React was created with a business-forward mindset by leveraging faster web-page load speed, SEO friendliness and code reusability through combining the two technologies.

Businesses were quick to grasp this technology because of the simplicity it offered to developers; that is, the ability to learn React in bare minimum time. 

Code reusability with hassle-free addition/modification of functionalities in the existing system meant allocating significantly less time and budget on development and building larger teams, respectively.

The good thing about the Angular framework is that a new Angular 2 developer from another company will quickly familiarize themselves with all the requisite conventions. React projects are each different in terms of architectural decisions, and developers need to get familiar with the particular project setup.
