# My Web Development Environment

This is simple setup and software guide for web development in Linux(Ubuntu 16.04, 64bit) system. 

I wont list all the applications I have installed on the machine, but only the ones I consider relevant and more focused on web Development.

## Base system

## Productivity Tools
- [Boostnote](http://boostnote.io/) — My main note taking application. I use it mostly to store code snippets and reference material for my development activities.
